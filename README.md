# DeepGalerkinMethod
Neural network using the deep galerkin method

The aim goal of this project is to implement a deep neural network using the galerkin method for solving high dimensions PDE. 
We illustrate the performances and results with first pricing vanilla product in the Black and Scholes model, and then pricing exotics products in some stochastics models.
